Core Concepts
1. Indexing	- Simply put, Lucene uses an “inverted indexing” 
	of data – instead of mapping pages to keywords, it maps 
	keywords to pages just like a glossary at the end of any book.

2. Documents -  a document is a collection of fields, and 
	each field has a value associated with it.
	
3. Fields - Documents can have field data, where a field is typically a key holding a data value:

title: Goodness of Tea
body: Discussing goodness of drinking herbal tea...
Copy
Notice that here title and body are fields and could be searched for together or individually.

4. Analysis
An analysis is converting the given text into smaller and precise units for easy the sake of searching.

The text goes through various operations of extracting keywords, removing common words and punctuations, changing words to lower case, etc.

StandardAnalyzer – analyses based on basic grammar, removes stop words like “a”, “an” etc. Also converts in lowercase
SimpleAnalyzer – breaks the text based on no-letter character and converts in lowercase
WhiteSpaceAnalyzer – breaks the text based on white spaces
