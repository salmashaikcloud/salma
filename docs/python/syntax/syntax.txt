Python Basic Syntax 
    There is no use of curly braces or semicolon in Python programming language.
    It is English-like language. But Python uses the indentation to define a block of code. 
    Indentation is nothing but adding whitespace before the statement when it is needed.
Syntax:
    def func():  
       statement 1  
       statement 2  
       …………………  
       …………………  
         statement N 
Note:
    Instead of Semicolon as used in other languages, Python ends its statements with 
    a NewLine character.

Python Indentation
    Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
    Generally, we can use four whitespaces to define indentation.
    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, 
    the indentation in Python is very important.
    Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
    Python will give an error if you skip the indentation.
