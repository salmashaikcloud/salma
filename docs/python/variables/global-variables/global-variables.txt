What are global variables?
    Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global 
    variables.
    Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and 
    outside.
    Syntax:
        variable-name = value
        def functionName():
            print(variable-name)
        functionName()
        print(variable-name)
    Example:
        x = 5
        def myFun():
            print(x)
        myFun()
        print(x)

Note:
    If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this 
    variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. 
    The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and 
    with the original value.

            print(variable-name)
        functionName()
        print(variable-name)
    Example
        def globalFun():
            global x
