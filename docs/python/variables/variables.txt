What are Variables?
    Variables are containers for storing data values.

How to create variables?
    Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
    Syntax:
        variable-name = value
    Example:
        x = 5
    --
    Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even 
    change type after they have been set.
--
How to get variable data type?
    You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
    Syntax:
        print(type(variable-name))
    Example:
        print(type(x))
--
Is variables case-sensitive?
    Yes, Variables are case-sensitive
    Example:
        x = 5
        X = 10
        Here, x and X are not same

How to write variable names?
    A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name 
    (age, firstName, fullName). 
Rules for Python variables:
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character(_).
    A variable name cannot start with a number.
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores 
    (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
    A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

How to assign multiple values?
    There are 3 ways:
        1. Many Values to Multiple Variables
        2. One Value to Multiple Variables
        3. Unpack a Collection
--
Many Values to Multiple Variables
    Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line.
    Syntax:
        variable1, variable2, ...variable_n = value1, value2, ...value_n
    Example:
        x, y, z = 4, 5, 6
Note: 
    Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you 
    will get an error.
--
One Value to Multiple Variables
    You can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.
    Syntax:
        variable1 = variable2 = value
    Example:
        x = y = 10
--
Unpack a Collection
    If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. 
    Python allows you to extract the values into variables. 
    This is called unpacking.
    Syntax:
        arrayName = [value1, value2, .... value_n]
        variable1, variable2, ... variable_n = arrayName
    Example
        employees = ["salma", "sushma", "durga"]
        x, y, z = employees

Output Variables
    The print() function is often used to output variables.
    In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a 
    comma.
    The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to 
    separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
