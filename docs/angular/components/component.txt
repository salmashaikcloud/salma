How to create a component?
    1. Manually 
        Create a folder of view-employees in hrms/src/apps/employees
        In view-employees folder create a file like view-employee.component.ts
        In view-employee.component.ts create a class as ViewEmployee   
        Add Component decorator
        Next import the Component in particular file
        Example:
            import { Component } from "@angular/core";
            @Component({
                selector: 'app-view-employee',
                template: '<div> View Employees Works</div>'
                })
            export class ViewEmployee {
            }

        To use this component we need to add the component class name at the declarations in app.module.js file and import its path.
