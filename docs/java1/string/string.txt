What is String in Java?
    Once we create a String object we can't perform any changes in the existing
    memory location.
    If we are trying to perform any change on existing String object, for those 
    changes a new memory location created and changes will performed on new memory 
    location.

    This non changable behaviour is nothing but immutability of String

Example:
    public class Employee3 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
		    String firstName = new String("Salma");
            System.out.println(firstName.hashCode());
            firstName.concat("Shaik");
            System.out.println(firstName.hashCode());
	}
}

StringBuffer:
    Once we create a StringBuffer object we can perform any changes in the existing
    memory location.
    If we are trying to perform any change on existing StringBuffer object, for 
    those changes will happen in same memory location.
    This non changable behaviour is nothing but immutability of String

Example:
    public class Employee1 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
		    StringBuffer firstName = new StringBuffer("Salma");
            System.out.println(firstName.hashCode());
            firstName.append("Shaik");
            System.out.println(firstName.hashCode());
	    }
    }

In Object class equals method will compare if the two objects are equal or not
using == operator.
In String class equals() method is overriden for value comparision also.
means it will compare the values which are present in two objects.
Example:
    public class Employee2 {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
		    StringBuffer firstName = new StringBuffer("Salma");
		    StringBuffer lastName = new StringBuffer("Salma");
		    System.out.println(firstName == lastName);//false
		    System.out.println(firstName.equals(lastName));//false
	    }
    }
In StringBuffer equals() method is overriden, if you use equals() method
on StringBuffer objects, it will bind the equals method whic is available in 
Object class.
Example:
    public class Employee2 {
	    public static void main(String[] args) {
		    StringBuffer firstName = new StringBuffer("Salma");
		    StringBuffer lastName = new StringBuffer("Salma");
		    System.out.println(firstName == lastName);//false
		    System.out.println(firstName.equals(lastName));//false
	    }
    }
