What is a Class?
	Class is a combination of properties and methods.
	Properties defines the state of the object.
	Methods defines the behaviour of the object.
	Class is a logical entity, it is a blueprint of an object.
	Object is a physical entity, it is a instance of a class.

Syntax
class ClassName {
	// properties
		// Properties are declared in constructor itself in javascript language
		// Properties are not declared in constructor in java language
	// constructor
		// A class may only have one constructor in javascript language [0 or 1]
		// A class must have atleast one constructor in java language [1 or *]
	// methods
		// A class can have multiple methods [0 or *]
	}
Example
Employees.java
class Employees {
    //properties
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;

	// no org constructor
	Employees() {}

	//methods
	boolean createEmployee(){
		//approx 100 lines of code
	}
	List getEmployee(){
		//approx 100 lines of code
	}
	boolean updateEmployee(){
		//approx 100 lines of code
	}
	boolean deleteEmployee(){
	// approx 100 lines of code
	}
}

What is constructor?
	The constructor is a special method.
	It has to have the exact name as "ClassName".
	It is executed automatically when a new object is creating.
	It is used to initialize object properties.
syntax:
    ClassName() {}
    ClassName(org1, org2, org3) {
        this.prop1 = org1;
        this.prop2 = org2;
        this.prop3 = org3;
    }
Example:
    public Employees() {}
    public Employees(employeeId, email, phoneNumber) {
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
        this.email = email;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
    }
What is difference between no org constructor and org constructor?

	Without having class, we can't create an object.
