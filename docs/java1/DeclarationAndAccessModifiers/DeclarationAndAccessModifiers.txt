Java Source file structure
    A java program can contain any number but at-most one class can
    be declared as a public.
    If there is a public class then name of the file name nd public class name
    must be matched otherwise we will get compile time error.
Example:
    Employees.java
        public class Employees {
        }
        class Departments {
        }
        class Locations {
        }
case 1:
    If there is no public class then we can use any name as file name and there 
    is no restriction.
Example:
    Regions.java
        class Employees {
        }
        class Departments {
        }
        class Locations {
        }
--
case 2:
    If class Departments is public then name of the java file should be
    Departments.java otherwise we will get compile time error 
Example:
    Employees.java
        class Employees {
        }
        public class Departments {
        }
    CE: class Departments is public should be declared in a file named 
    Employees.java
--
case 3:
    If class Departments and Employees declared as public and name of the file 
    is Employees.java then we will grt compile time error.
Employees.java
    public class Employees {
        public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("A Class Main");
        }
    }
    public class Departments {
        public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("B Class Main");
        }
    }
    CE: class Departments is public should be declared in a file named 
    Employees.java
--
case 4:
Employees.java
    public class Employees{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("This is main");
    }
    }
    class Departments{
    }
    class Locations{
    }
javac Employees.java
    Employees.class
    Departments.class
    Locations.class
java Employees
output : This is main
java Departments
RE : Main method not found in class Departments

Conclusions
    Whenever we are compiling a java program a separate .class file will be
    generated for every class present in that java file.
    
    We can compile a .java file, we can run a .class file.

    Whenever we are executing a java class the corresponding class main()
    method will be executed. If the class doesn't contain main method then we
    will get a run-time error.
    RE : Main method not found in class ClassName.

Case 5:
    If the corresponding .class file not available then we will get runtime
    Error: NoClassDefFoundError.
Note:
    It is not recommended to declare multiple classes in a single source file,
    It is highly recommended to declare only one class per source file and name
    of the program we have to keep same as class name.
    the main advantage of this approach is readability and maintainability of
    the code will be improved.
