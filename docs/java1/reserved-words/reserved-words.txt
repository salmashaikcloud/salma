7. void return type (1)
    void
    return type is manidetory in java, if a method dont not return anything
    then we have to declare that method with void return type.
    but in 'c' return type is optional and default return type in int.
    but in 'javascript' return type is optional and no default return type.
8. Unused keywords
    a. goto 
        usage of goto create several problems in old languages and hence 
        sun-micro-systems banned to use this keyword in java.
    b. const
        use final instead of const.
    Note: goto and const are unused keywords and if we are trying to use
    we will get compile time error.
9. Reserved literals
    true, false valuses for boolean datatypes
    null is default value for object reference.
10. enum(1.5) keyword
    We can use enum to define a group of named constants.
    enum Month{
        Jan, Feb, ...., Dec;
    }

Conclusion
1. All 53 reserved words in java contains only lower case alphabet symbols.
2. In java we have new keyword and there is no delete keyword because
    jvm will takes care of deletion of un-referenced objects.

3. The following are new keywords in java.
    1. strictfp(1.2)
    2. assert(1.4)
    3. enum(1.5)

4. strictfp         but not strictFp
    instanceof      but not instanceOf
    synchronized    but not synchronize
    extends         but not extend
    implements      but not implement
    import          but not imports
    const           but not constant
