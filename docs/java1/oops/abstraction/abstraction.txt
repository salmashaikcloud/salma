What is abstraction?
    Hiding the internal implementation details and showing only its
    specification.
    By using abstract classes and interfaces we can implement abstraction.
--
The main advantange of abstraction are 
    1. We can achieve security because we are not highlighting our internal
        implementation.
    2. Without affecting outside person we can able to perform any type of changes
        in our internal system and hence enhancement will become easy.
    3. It improves maintainability of the application.
    4. It improves easiness to use our system.
