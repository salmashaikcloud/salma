What is a Class?
    Class is a combination of properties and methods.
    Properties defines the state of the object.
    Methods defines the behaviour of the object.
    Class is a logical entity, it is a blueprint of an object.
    Object is a physical entity, it is a instance of a class.

Example:
    Class           Constructor     Object
    Blueprint       Constructor     Home1, Home2, Home3
    Prescription    Medicalshop     Medicines1, Medicines2, Medicines3
    Employees       Constructor     Salma, Sajid, Majid, Reshma
    Account         Constructor     SalmaAccount, SravathiAccount
--
Syntax:
class ClassName {
    // properties
        // Properties are declared in constructor itself in javascript language
        // Properties are not declared in constructor in java language
    // constructor
        // A class may only have one constructor in javascript language [0 or 1]
        // A class can have atleast one constructor in java language [1 or *]
    // methods
        // A class can have multiple methods [0 or *]
}
Example:
class Employees {
    // properties
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    // no org constructor
    Employees() {
    }

    // methods
    boolean createEmployee() {
        //approx 100 lines of code
    }
    List getEmployee() {
        //approx 100 lines of code
    }
    boolean updateEmployees() {
        //approx 100 lines of code
    }
    boolean deleteEmployee() {
        //approx 100 lines of code
    }

What is constructor?
    The constructor is a special method.
    It has to have exact name as "ClassName".
    It is executed sutomatically when a new object is created.
    It is used to initialize object properties.
Syntax:
    ClassName() {}
    ClassName(org1, org2, org3) {
        this.prop1 = org1;
        this.prop2 = org2;
        this.prop3 = org3;
    }
Example:
    public Employees() {}
    public Employees(employeeId, email, phoneNumber) {
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
        this.email = email;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
    }
What is the difference between no org constructor and org constructor?
==
What is an Object?
    Object is an instance of a class, it is a physical entity and it is a 
    real world entity.
    Without having class, we can't create an object.

What is a final Class?
What is the use of the final class?
    final class won't allow to create an object.
    you can access variables and methods using the class name only.
