Data Types
    In java every variable and expression have some, type, and every type is
    strictly defined.
    Every assignment should be checked by the compiler for compatibility.
    Because of the above reason we can console java language is strongly typed
    programming language.
    Java is not consider as pure Object-Oriented Programming Language.
    Because of primitive datatypes which are not objects.
    Because of few OOPs features (operator overloading, multiple inheritance,
    etc.) are not satisfied by java.
Data Types
    non-numeric (Unsigned)
        boolean
        char
    Numaric (Signed)
        Integral
        Floating
    Except boolean and char data types, remaining data types are signed data
    types, because we can save both the positive and negative numbers.
