Explain Java main method?
    The main() method is the starting point for JVM.
    Without the main() method, JVM will not execute the developer method.
--
The syntax of the main() method is 
    public static void main(String[] args){}
--
public:
    It is an access specifier. We should use a keyword before the main()
    method so that JVM can identify the execution point of the program.
    If we use private, protected, and default before the main() method, it will
    not be visible to JVM.
static:
    Static methods are executed Without creating the object, so we do not need
    to create an object to call the main() method from JVM.
    You can make a method as a static method by using the keyword static.
    JVM will call the main() method Without creating an object.

void:
    in Java, every method 

main():
    It is a default signature which is predefined in the JVM. It is called by
    JVM to execute a program. We can also overload the main() method.

String args[]:
    The main() method also accepts some data from the user. It accepts a group
    of strings, which is called a string array.
    It is used to hold the command line arguments in the form of string values.
    agrs[] is the array name, and it is string type. It means that it can store 
    a group of strings.
    agrs[] array can also store a group of numbers, but in the form string
    only.
    Values passed to the main() method is called arguments.
    These arguments are stored into args[] array, so the mame args[] is 
    generally used for it.

Overloading of main() method
    We can also overload the main() method. We can define any number of main()
    method in the class, but the method signature must be different.

FAQs
What happens if the main() method is written in the program without (string[] args)?
We will get the run time error as main method is not found.
