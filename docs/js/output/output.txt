What are the display possibilities in javascript?
    innerHTML
    console.log()
    document.write()
    window.alert()
    window.print()

innerHTML
    To access HTML element, javascript can use the document.getElementById("id")
	method.
    The id attribute defines the HTML element and the content inside the HTML 
    element is the innerHTML.
--
console.log()
    It is used for debugging purpose.
    If we want to display data in console, then write data into colsole.log()
    method.
--
document.write()
    It is used for testing purpose.
    Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, it will delete all
    existing elements from html element and writes the data into body element.
    The document.write() should be used only for testing.
--
window.alert()
    We can use an alert box to display data.
    We can skip the window keyword in window.alert() it is an optional.
--
window.print()
    JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.
    You have to call window.print() method in the browser to print the current 
    page. You cannot access output devices from the javascript.
