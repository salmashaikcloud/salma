What is BOM?
    The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser.
    There are no official standards for the Browser Object Model(BOM).
    Since modern browsers have implemented (almost) the same methods and 
	properties for JavaScript interactivity, it is often referred to, as methods
	and properties of the BOM.

What is Window Object?
    The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's 
    window.
    All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become
    members of the window object.
    Global variables are properties of the window object.
    Global functions are methods of the window object.
    All objects are childs of the window object.

Even the document object(of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:

window.document.getElementById("header");
is the same as:
document.getElementById("header");

Window Size
Two properties can be used to determine the size of the browser window.

Both properties return the sizes in pixels:

window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)
window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)
The browser window (the browser viewport) is NOT including toolbars and 
scrollbars

Example:
	let w = window.innerWidth;
	let h = window.innerHeight;
	Other Window Methods
	Some other methods:
	
	window.open() - open a new window
	window.close() - close the current window
	window.moveTo() - move the current window
	window.resizeTo() - resize the current window
