What is sort?
	The sort() method sorts an array alphabetically.(ascending order)
	let employees = ["Salma", "Durga", "Sushma", "Azhar"];
	employees.sort();
--
What is reverse?
	The reverse() method reverse the elements in an array.
	let employees = ["Salma", "Durga", "Sushma", "Azhar"];
	employees.reverse();
Note: By combining sort() and reverse() we can sort an array in descending order.

What is Numeric Sort?
	By default, the sort() function sorts values as strings.
	This works well for strings.
	The sort method will produce incorrect result when sorting numbers.
	Fix this by providing a compare function.
Example:
	let numbers = [54, 68, 55, 15, 44, 4];
	numbers.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
Same trick uses to sort an array descending order.
Example:
	let numbers = [54, 68, 55, 15, 44, 4];
	numbers.sort(function(a, b){return b - a});
--
Sorting an Array in Random Order:
Example:
	let numbers = [54, 68, 55, 15, 44, 4];
	numbers.sort(function(){return 0.5 - Math.random()});

How to find the Lowest or Highest Array Value?
	There are no built-in functions for finding the max or min value in an array.
	However, after you have sorted an array, you can use the index to obtain the 
	highest and lowest values.
	Ascending Sort:
		array[0] contains the lowest value
		array[length-1] contains the highest value
	Descending Sort:
		array[0] contains the highest value
		array[length-1] contains the lowest value

Using Math.max() on an Array:
	You can use Math.max.apply to find the highest number in an array.
Syntax:
	Math.max.apply(null, array);
--
Using Math.min() on an Array:
	You can use Math.min.apply to find the lowest number in an array.
Syntax:
	Math.min.apply(null, array);
