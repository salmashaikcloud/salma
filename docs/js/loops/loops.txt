What is loop?
	To execute logic repeatedly.
	or
	To run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
	or 
	Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

What are the different kinds of loops?
	-for
		loops through a block of code a number of times.
	-for/in
		loops through the properties of an object.
	-for/of
		loops through the values of an array.
	-while
		loops through a block of code if the specified condition is true.
		If the condition is true then only executes the block of code.
	-do/while
		loops through a block of code if the specified condition is true.
		It will executes the block of code at least once and checks the condition.

For 
	Syntax:
	for(initialization; condition ; increment/decrement) {
		//write you code here..., may be single line or 100 lines
		//getEmployee();
		//it will executed multiple times based upon the condition
	}
	Example:
	for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		console.log("This is my logic i want to execute 10 times" + i);
	}
	const employees = ["Steven", "Neena", "Lex", "Alexander", "David", "Valli"];
	for (let i = 0; i < employees.length; i++) {
		console.log(employees[i]);
	}
	// array index = 5 length = 6;
	// index = length - 1;
--
What is for In?
	for in statements loops through the properties of an Object.
	Syntax:
		for (property in object) {
			//code block to be executed
		}
	Example:
		function forIn() {
			const employee = {employeeId="101",firstName:"Salma",lastName:"Shaik"}
			let text = "";
			for (let property in employee) {
				text += employee[property] + "<br>";
			}
			document.getElementById("employees").innerHTML = text;
		}
--
What is For Of?
	for of statement loops through the values of an iterable array.
	Syntax:
		for (value of iterable) {
			// code block to be executed
		}
	Example:
		function forOf() {
			const employees = ["Steven", "Neena", "Lex"];
			let text = "";
			for (let employee of employees) {
				text += employee + "<br>";
			}
			document.getElementById("employees").innerHTML = text;
		}

What is for loop?
	loops through a block of code a number of times.
	The for statements creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:
Syntax:
	for (expression 1/initialization; expression 2/condition; expression 3/increment/decrement) {
		//code block to be executed.
	}
	Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
	Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
	Expression 3 is executed(every time) after the code block has been executed.
Example:
	for (let i=0; i<5; i++) {
		//write a logic
	}
--
What is for in loop?
	for in statements loops through the properties of an object.
Syntax:
	for (key in object) {
		//code block to be executed
	}
