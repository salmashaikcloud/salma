JavaScript Syntax:
	It is the set of rules and regulations, how JavaScript programs are 
	constructed.
--
What are JavaScript values?
	The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
		1. Fixed values
			Fixed values are called Literals.
		2. Variable values
			Variable values are called Variables.
--
What are the rules for JavaScript Literals?	
	The two important rules for fixed literals are
		1. Numbers are written with or without decimals.
			Example:
				1000
				10.50
		2. Strings are text written within double or single quotes.
			Example:
				"John"
				'John'

What are JavaScript Variables?
	In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
	JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
	An equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
		Example:
			let x;
			x =6;
--	
What are JavaScript Operators?
	There are two types of operators.
		Arithmetic operators.
		Assignment operators.
	JavaScript uses arithmetic operators( + - * /) to compute values.
	JavaScript uses an assignment operator( = ) to assign values to variables.
--
What is JavaScript Expression?
	An expression is a combination of values, variables and operators, which 
	computes to a value.
	The computation is called evaluation.
	Expressions can also contain variable values.
	The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
	Example:
		"John" + " " + "Doe";
		It evaluates to "John Doe".
		var n1 = 10 + 12; // 22
		var n2 = "10" + "12"; // 1012
--
What are JavaScript Keywords?
	JavaScript keywords [63] are used to identify actions to be performed.
	The let keyword tells the browser to create variables.
	The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables.
	By using var or let keywords, the result will be same.
--
What are JavaScript Comments?
	Not all JavaScript statements are executed.
	Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
	Comments are ignored, and will not be executed.
