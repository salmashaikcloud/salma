Why we need to study javascript?
    For developing web pages we need 3 languages.
        1. HTML to define content of web page.
        2. CSS to specify the layout/style of web pages.
        3. Javascript to program the behaviour of web pages.
    It gives the behaviour to the HTML code, and validations are done by using 
    javascript only.
    Without javascript, the HTML code specifies that body with no brain.
