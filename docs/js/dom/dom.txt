What is DOM?
    The Document Object Model(DOM) is a W3C standard.
    The W3C DOM is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows
    programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, 
    structure and style of a document.
    The W3C standard is separated into 3 different parts:
        1. Core DOM -standard model for all document types
        2. XML DOM  -standard model for XML documents
        3. HTML DOM -standard model for HTML documents

What is HTML DOM?
    With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an 
	HTML document.
    The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for
	HTML. It defines:
        The HTML elements as objects
        The properties of all HTML elements
        The methods to access all HTML elements
        The events for all HTML elements
    In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or 
	delete HTML elements.
