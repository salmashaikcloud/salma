Why we need to use conditional statements?
    Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on 
    different conditions.
--
What are the conditional statements?
    There are four types:
    1. if
    2. else
    3. else if ladder
    4. switch case
--
What is if statement?
    To specify a block of code to be executed if a condition is true.
    Or
    if the specified condition is true, then only if block of code will execute.
Syntax:
    if (condition) {
        // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
    }
Example:
    if(age >=18){
        //write a logic for applying voter card
    }
--
What is else statement?
    To specify a block of code to be executed if condition is false.
    Or
    if the specified condition is false, then only else block of code will execute.
Syntax:
    if (condition) {
        // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
    }
    else {
        // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
    }
Example:
    if(age >= 18) {
        //write a logic for applying voter card
    }
    else {
        //write a logic to show information of the user
    }
--
What is else if statement?
    To specify a block of code to be executed if the first condition is false.
    Or
    else if statement is used to specify a new condition.
    if the condition is true, it will execute if block.
    if the condition is false, it will execute else block.
Syntax:
    if (condition1) {
        // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is true
    }
    else if(condition2){
        // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
    }
    else {
        // block of code to be executed if the condition1 and condition2 is false
    }
Example:
    if(class<=5) {
        //Go to Primary school
    }
    else if(class<=10) {
        //Go to High school
    }
    else if(class<=12) {
        //Go to Inter college
    }
    else if(class<=15) {
        //Go to Degree college
    }
    else {
        //Go to PG college
    }
What is switch case?
    if you want to check more conditions (more than 4), its better to use switch 
    instead of else if ladder.
