What is function?
    function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
    function is executes when "something" invokes it(calls it).
Syntax:
    function <return_type> function_name(
        <parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, ....parameter-n>) {
        // block of code [sometime we will write 100 lines of code]
        // designed to perform a particular task
        <return value>;
        }
Example:
    function boolean createEmployee(firstName, lastName, phoneNo) {
        // block of code [sometime we will write 100 lines of code]
        // designed to perform a particular task
    }
    parameters are listed inside the parenthesis() in the function definition. 
    arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
    Inside the function, the arguments (parameters) behave as local variables.
---
What is function Invocation?
    The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes(calls) 
    the function.
Example:
    createEmployees("salma", "shaik", 9876543210);
---
What is function return statement?
    When function reaches "return" statement, it will returns the value to the 
    caller function and it will stop executing the function.
    We have to write return statement at the end of the method.
    Syntax:
    function functionNode () {
        //block of code
        return something;
    }
    Example:
    function addition(n1, n2) {
        let res = n1 + n2;
        return res;
    }

Why Functions?
    You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
    You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce 
    different results.

Functions used as Variable Values
    Syntax:
    let variableName = functionName();
    Example:
    let variableName = addition(10, 20);
--
Local Variables
    Variables declared within a function, become LOCAL to the function.
    Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
    Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions.
    Variables with the same name can be used in different functions.
    Local variables are created when a function starts, and declared when the
    function is completed.
    Syntax:
    function functionName() {
        let n1;
        let n2;
        let res;
        //block of code
        return res;
    }
    Example:
    function addition() {
        let n1 = 10;
        let n2 = 20;
        let res = n1 + n2;
        //block of code
        return res;
    }
