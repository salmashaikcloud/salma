What is switch statement?
    To select one of many code blocks to be executed.
Syntax:
    switch(expression) {
        case x:
            // code block
            break;
        case y:
            // code block
            break;
        default:
            // code block
    }

How switch statements works?
    -The switch expression is evaluated once.
    -The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
    -If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
    -If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
--
What is break keyword?
    -It breaks out of the switch block.
    -This will stop the execution inside the switch block.
    -It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. 
    -The block breaks (ends) there anyway.
Note:
If there is no break then the execution contains with the next case without any 
checks.

What is default keyword?
    -To specifies the code to run if there is no case match.
--
What is common code blocks?
    Sometimes you want different switch cases to use the same code.(code which 
	is grouped together.)

Strict Comparison
    Switch cases use strict comparison (===).
    The values must be of the same type to match.
    A strict comparison can only be true if the operands are of the same type.
