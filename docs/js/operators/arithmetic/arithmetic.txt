JavaScript Arithmetic Operators?
	Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:
	Operators	Description
		+		Addition
		-		Subtraction
		*		Multipication
		**		Exponentiation (ES2016)
		/		Division
		%		Modulus (Division Remainder)
		++		Increment
		--		Decrement
--
Exponentiation Operator
	The exponentiation operator (x ** y) raises a to the power of b.
	Example:
		let x = 5;
		let z = x ** 2;
	--
	x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y):
	Example:
		let x = 5;
		let y = 3;
		let z = Math.pow(x,3);

Increment
Increment ++ increases a variable by 1.
	If the operator (++) goes after the variable, it is in "postfix form": x++;
	If the operator (++) goes before the variable, it is in "prefix form": ++y;
	
	Both of these statements do the same thing: increase value by 1.
	But there is a difference between postfix increment and prefix increment.
		The postfix form x++ also increment x value but returns the old value.
		The prefix form ++y also increment x value but returns the new value.

Note:
	In postfix 
	If we are assigning like x = x++; here x value remains same.
	If we are assigning like a = x++; here x value increase by 1 and a value 
	will be the old value of x.	
--
Decrement
Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1.
	If the operator (--) goes after the variable, it is in "postfix form": x--;
	If the operator (--) goes before the variable, it is in "prefix form": --y;
	
	Both of these statements do the same thing: decreases value by 1.
	But there is a difference between postfix decrement and prefix decrement.
		The postfix form x-- also decrement x value but returns the old value.
		The prefix form --y also decrement x value but returns the new value.

Note:
	In postfix 
	If we are assigning like x = x--; here x value remains same.
	If we are assigning like a = x--; here x value decrease by 1 and a value 
	will be the old value of x.

JavaScript Operator Precedence
	Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in
	an arithmetic expression.
	Order:
		/ > * > + > -
Note:
	Expressions in parentheses are performed before the rest of the expression
