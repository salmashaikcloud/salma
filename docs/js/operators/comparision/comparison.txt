JavaScript Comparison Operators?
Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and
take action depending on the result.
	Operator	Description
	   ==		equal to
	   ===		equal value and equal type
	   !=		not equal
	   !==		not equal value or equal type
	   >		greater than
	   <		less than

Boolean is the result
	All comparison operators return a boolean value:
		true	- means "yes", "correct", or "the truth".
		false	- means "no", "wrong", or "not the truth".

String Comparison
	To compare Strings, JavaScript uses the "dictionary" or “lexicographical” 
	order.
	In other words, strings are compared letter-by-letter.
	Example:
		let x = "Hello";
		let y = "Hi";
		console.log(x > y); //false
		console.log(x < y); //true

Note:
	For instance, case matters. A capital letter "A" is not equal to the 
	lowercase "a". 
	Which one is greater? The lowercase "a".
	Because the lowercase character has a greater index in the internal encoding
	table JavaScript uses(Unicode).
