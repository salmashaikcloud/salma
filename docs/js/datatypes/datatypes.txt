What are Data Types?
    Javascript variables can hold different datatypes such as
        undefined
        number
        bigint

number
    Range
        [+(253-1) to (-253-1)]
        900719925470991 to -900719925470991 (accurate up to 15digits)
    Syntax:
        variable_type variable_name = number;
    Example:
        let n1 = 1234;
--
bigint
    Range
        []
    Syntax:
        variable_type variable_name = number+n;
    Example:
        let n1 = 4515487845454874512n;
--
String
    Syntax:
        variable_type variable_name = "number+n";
    Example:
        let n1 = "4865454877845116648787878787_no_length_limit";
