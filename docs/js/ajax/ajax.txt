What is synchronous?
	Executing the functions or code one-by-one/line-by-line is called 
	synchronous.
	Example:
		Booking the movie tickets from one counter.
--
What is Asynchronous?
	Executing the functions or code parallely is called asynchonous.
	Example:
		Booking the movie tickets from multiple counters.

What is AJAX?
	AJAX is not a programming language, it is a part of javascript.
	AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers [Example: Tomcat]
	from a web page [Example: Chrome].
	AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
	JavaScript ia synchronous by default.
	By using ajax we can implement asynchonous mechanism in javascript.
	By default javascript won't wait for to get response from the server.
--
What is Usage of AJAX?
	By using AJAX we can perform CURD operations.
		We can Read data from a web server.
		We can Send data to a web server.
		We can Update a web page without reloading the page.
		We can Delete the records from the database.

How AJAX Works?
	AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchonously by exchanging data with a 
	web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts
	of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
	AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport 
	data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.

1, 2, 7, 8					3, 6				4, 5
	1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
	2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by javascript.
	3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a server.
	4. The sever processes the request.
	5. The server prepares the reponse object.
	6. The server sends a response object back to the web page.
	7. The reponse is read ny javascript.
	8. Proper action (like page update) is performed by javascript.

How to get XMLHttpRequest Object?
1. Create an XMLHttpRequest object.
	Syntax:
		let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
--
2. Open request to a server.
	Syntax:
		xhr.open("method_name", "http://hostname:portnum/appname/service_url", 
		sync/async 
		type);
	Example:
		xhr.open("GET", "regions_url", true);
		xhr.open ("POST", "regions_url");
--
3. Send request to a server
	Syntax:
		xhr.send();
		xhr.send(request_body);
	Example:
		xhr.send();
		xhr.send("'regionid':1,
					'regionName':'Europe'");
--
4. Define a class back function.
	A callback function is passed as a parameter to another function.
	Syntax:
		xhr.onload = function() {
		//process the response object.
		}

What is Access Across Domains?
What is CORS policy issue?
	For security reasons, modren browsers do not allow access across domains.
	This means that both the web page and the XML file it tries to load, must 
	be located on the same server.
	The examples on aadhaar all persons pic located on the aadhaar domain.
	If you want to use the example above onone of your own web pages, persons
	pics you load must be located on your own server.
	Example
		aadhaar		aadhaar.com 
	--
	Enabled
		phonePe		phonepe.com
		gpay		gpay.com
		jio			jio.com user-reg.html
	USA 
		Embassy usaembassy.com
	--
	Restricted
	Pakistan
		rupe rupe.com

What are XMLHttpRequest Object Methods?
	Create an XMLHttpRequest object
	Define a callback function
	Open the XMLHttpRequest object
	Send a Request to a server
--
Is javascript asynchronous by default?
	No, javascript is always synchronous (one-by-one or queue).
--
XML or JSON?
	Carrying the data to and from the server to the browser we can use XML and 
	JSON
	JSON is understandable, shorter and faster then XML.
--
What is XMLHttpRequest?
	XMLHttpRequest is used for asynchonous communication between browser and
	server.
	Sends data from the browser to serve in the background.
	Receives the data from the serve to browser.
	Updates the data on webpage without reloading.
--
Properties of XMLHttpRequest?
	onreadystatechange:
		It is called whenever readystate attribute changes.
		It must not be used with synchronous requests.
	readystate
		represents the state of the request. It ranges from 0 to 4.
		Holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.
		0: request not initialized
		1: server connection established
		2: request received
		3: processing request
		4: request finished and response is ready
		
		responseText : returns response as text.
		responseXML returns : response as XML.
--
Methods of XMLHttpRequest?
	open(method, URL);
		opens the request specifying get or post method and url.
	open(method, URL, async);
		same as above but specifies asynchonous or not.
	open(method, URL, async, username, password);
		same as above but specifies username and password.
	send()
		sends get request.
	send(string)
		send post request.
	setRequestHeader(header, value): it adds request headers.
	//TODO
--
What is difference between onreadystatechange and readystate?
	The onreadystatechange property defines a function to be executed when the 
	readyState changes.
	The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.
