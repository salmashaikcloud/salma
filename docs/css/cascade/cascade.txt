What is the Cascading Order in css?
	or
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML
element?
	All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the
	following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
		1. inline CSS
		2. internal CSS
		3. external CSS
		4. browser default style
	So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and
	internal and browser defaults.
