HTML paragraph:
    The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
    A paragraph always starts on a new line and browsers automatically add some 
	white space before and after paragraph.
    Example:
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a second paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is a third paragraph.</p>

Paragraph Display:
    You cannot be sure how Paragraph will be displayed.
    Large or small screens, resized windows will create default results.
    With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra space or extra 
	lines in HTML code.
    The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces or lines when the 
	page is displayed.
    Example:
        <p>This is a 
        paragraph with
        many lines in
		source code</p>

        <p>This paragraph contains    lot
        of spaces  in    the    source  code,
        but the    browser  ignores it.</p>

        <p>The number of lines in the paragraph depends on the size of the
        browser, if you resize the browser window the number of lines in the 
		paragraph will change.</p>
