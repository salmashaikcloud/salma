HTML Attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about HTML element.
    All html elements can have attributes.
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag only.
    Attributes usually come in name value pair like.
    attribute-name = "attribute-value".
Example:
    <student name="salma" dob="05-10-2001" fn="shaik" ln="salma"></student>
    Attributes are two types
        Global Attributes
            id, class, style and etc....
        Local Attributes
            src, href, alt and etc....
--  
href attribute
    The <a> tag defines a hyperlink.
    The href attribute specifies the URL of the page.
Example:
    <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com"> Visit W3Schools</a>
--
src attribute
    The <img> tag is used to embed an image in html page.
    The src attribute specifies the path of the image to be displayed.
Example:
    <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
--
alt attribute
    The alt attribute of an <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image,
    if the image for some reason cannot displayed.
    This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute.
Example:
    <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with jacket">
--
style attribute
    The style attribute is used to add style to an element, such as color,
    font, size and more.
Example:
    <p style="color:red;">style</p>
--
lang attribute
    You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag,
    to declare the language of the webpage.
    This is meant to assist search engine and browsers.
Example:
    <html lang="te"></html>
    Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute.
    Example:
    <html lang="en-US"></html>
--
title attribute
    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
Example:
    <h1 title="i'm a header">The title Attribute<h1>
    <p title="This is tooltip">
        Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.
    </p>

Note 01:
    Always use lowercase Attributes
    The Attributes can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or 
    TITLE, but using lowercase is a better way.
--
Note 02:
    Single or Double Quotes
    Double Quotes around the attributes are the most common in HTML,
    but single Quotes can also be used.
Example:
    <p title="This is a TITLE">Title with single quotes</p>
    <p title='This is a TITLE'>Title with single quotes</p>
--
Note 03:
When the attribute value itself contains Double Quotes, then it is 
necessary to use Single Quotes.
Example:
    <p title="This is a 'TITLE'">Title with single quotes</p>
    <p title='This is a "TITLE"'>Title with single quotes</p>
