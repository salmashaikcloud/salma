HTML Comments Tags
    HTML comments cannot be displayed in the browser, but they can help 
    developers to understand HTML code.
    You can add comments to the HTML source code by using the following syntax.
    Syntax:
        <!--write your comments here-->
    There is an exclamation point(!) in the start tag and not in the end tag.
    With comments you can make notifications and remainders in HTML code:
    Example:
        <!--This is a comment-->
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <!--Remember to add more information here-->
