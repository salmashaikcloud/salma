Upload the documents from the specific source directory to the database.
==
The upload should happen in a regular interval may be for every 1 minute.
==
It has to upload the documents in ascending order in a sequential manner.
==
If the documents name format in source folder is like below
	document-name-1.pdf
	document-name-2.pdf
	document-name-3.pdf
	salma.pancard.pdf
	

Instead of uploading a new document, you need to upload a new revision,
and you should not delete old revision.

Whenever user is trying to download, we have to provide a option to download
new revision by default.
